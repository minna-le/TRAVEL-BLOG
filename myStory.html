              I am Minna, an aspiring software developer from Finland and a
              proud mom of a spirited 3-year-old. I feel fortunate to have my
              parents, who are still healthy, from Vietnam, along with my
              beloved sister from the US, who is not only very close to me but
              also shares my passion for traveling together. Our family
              frequently travels across continents to reconnect and create
              cherished memories together.
            </p>
            <p>
              This blog fulfills my deep desire to preserve our family moments,
              photos, and experiences. It also serves as a testament to my
              journey as a software developer, beginning with my passion for
              crafting user-friendly websites that bring our stories to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this platform, I hope to inspire families to include their
              grandparents in their travels, fostering memories that span
              generations. I believe in the importance of valuing our family
              connections, sharing unique experiences, and strengthening our
              bonds while exploring the world together.
